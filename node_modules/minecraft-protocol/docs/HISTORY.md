 * cross version support exposed : version option in createClient and createServer
 * expose createSerializer and createDeserializer, createPacketBuffer and parsePacketData are now available in serializer/parser instances (BREAKING CHANGE)
 * stop exposing packetFields, packetNames, packetIds, packetStates. That data is available by requiring minecraft-data package (BREAKING CHANGE)
 * don't expose version anymore but supportedVersions (BREAKING CHANGE)
 * use node-yggdrasil : index.js now doesn't expose yggdrasil, use node-yggdrasil directly if needed (BREAKING CHANGE)
 * createServers's beforePing option can now takes an async function
 * enable compression by default in createServer

 * Server clients have a new property, client.profile, containing the result

 * Protocol.json now lives in minecraft-data
 * Don't bubble up errors from client to server. (BREAKING CHANGE). If you want
   to catch the client errors, you need to add an error listener on that client.
   The old behavior was confusing, error-prone and undocumented !
 * Add keepAlive option to createServer, in order to optionally disable it.
 * Lots of low-level changes to allow minecraft-data to be more generic.
 * NMP code is able to work with both 1.8 and 1.9 data with the same code,
   opening a path for cross-versioning.
 * The packet events now take two parameters : `function (packetData, packetMetadata)`
   * `packetMetadata` contains the packet name, id and state (more may be added later)
   * `packetData` contains the actual data content

## 0.14.0

 * Huge rewrite of the internals, using transform streams, which eliminates two
   classes of problems from node-minecraft-protocol :
   * Uncatchable errors being triggered inside the protocol parser
   * Packets ariving out of order, causing several race conditions
 * All the attributes that were previously exposed via `mc.protocol` are now directly
   attached to the `mc` object, e.g. `mc.protocol.states` => `mc.states`. This is
   prone to further changes.
 * open_window now reports the entityId correctly for horses
 * Properly handle the set_compression packet
 * Fix small bug in scoreboard_team and player_info packets causing crashes
 * Fix the login implementation logging out people from their launchers.

## 0.13.4

 * Added hook to modify server ping (thanks [Brian Schlenker](https://github.com/bschlenk))
 * Exposed the Client class to the browser, after removing node-specific details

 * Lots of changes in how some formats are handled.

 * writing packets is 6% faster (thanks [Matt Bell](https://github.com/mappum))

## 0.7.9

## 0.7.8

 * server: ability to change `motd` and `maxPlayers`

## 0.7.7

 * server: fix crash when client disconnects quickly

## 0.7.6

 * onlineModeExceptions are all lowercase now. fixes security hole.

   - online mode: these usernames are exempt from online mode.
   - offline mode: these usernames must authenticate.

 * `createServer`: rename `encryption-enabled` option to `encryption` to stay
   consistent with the examples. (thanks [Robin Lambertz](https://github.com/roblabla))
 * `createClient`: don't require both `email` and `username`.
   - The `username` and `password` arguments are used to authenticate with the
     official minecraft servers and determine the case-correct username. If
     you have migrated your user account to a mojang login, `username` looks
     like an email address.
   - If you leave out the `password` argument, `username` is used to connect
     directly to the server. In this case you will get kicked if the server is
     in online mode.

## 0.6.7

Emit 'error' event instead of crashing when other computers abuse the
minecraft protocol.

Big thanks to [Robin Lambertz](https://github.com/roblabla) for this release.
